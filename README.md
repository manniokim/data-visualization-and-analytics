# data-visualization-and-analytics


this is a sample of some data visualization and data analysis work that I have done. The first file which is a powerpoint presentation shows a visualization( bar chart) comparing the google searches( data from google trends)from different states in Nigeria of three Nigerian popstars namely Fireboy DML, Joeboy and Rema in the last 12 months. The second visualization is a bar chart comparing differnt brands of cars and their prices.

In the second file, which is an IPYNB file contains a csv data set of used cars, brands, models, year of registration and their prices and other variables like engine volume, mileage etc. I used python and its libraries to clean, perform exploratory and advanced data analysis on the datasets, visualize the data with seaborn and matplotlib libraries and I used Scikit-learn build a linear regression mdoel for predictive analysis.
